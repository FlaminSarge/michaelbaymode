MichaelBayMode
============
A SourceMod plugin for Team Fortress 2 which I should probably regret ever making. 

- If a player dies, they will create a massive explosion and shake nearby player's screens.
- If you shoot your weapon, you scream "RUN FOR YOUR LIFE!".
- It also changes/randomises the pitch of sounds played by the game engine.

## WARNING
Please note that this plugin can cause extreme server and client instability if the rate of fire console variable is set too high with many players and high entity counts.

## Extensions required 
- TF2 extension (bundled with SourceMod)
- SteamTools (for custom game description)

## Plugins required
- None

## Custom includes required
- morecolours

## Console Variables
- tf_awesomemod_enabled (0/1) - Default: 1 - Is AwesomeMod enabled?
- tf_awesomemod_rof (1.0 - 100.0) - Every weapon's rate-of-fire is multiplied by this value.
